### Hi there 👋

I'm Alan Benedict Golpeo, a passionate enthusiast of JavaScript and PHP, along with their widely-used frameworks. My expertise extends to Docker, Linux, and Python, where I hold an intermediate level of knowledge. I derive great satisfaction from tailoring the layouts of WordPress websites, employing both manual customization and programmatic theme editing. In my spare time, I engage in freelancing and take on various projects, ranging from crafting single-page applications (SPAs) to developing Web3-integrated websites.
